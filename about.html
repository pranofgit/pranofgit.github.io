        <h1>About Me</h1>
             <p>
                I am a data scientist by profession. With a strong background in theoretical physics, I've completed 
                my five year Integrated MSc. from IIT-Roorkee and PhD from HBNI-Mumbai specializing in string theory.
                Now, I find myself delving into the world of data and numbers.
             </p>
             <p>
                Currently, I am working on analysing time series data for supply chain management.
                My work focuses on understanding trends and making predictions to optimize various aspects of supply chain processes.
             </p>
             <p>
                Apart from this, I have a keen interest in quantitative finance. I believe that my interest in numbers and equations, fostered by my physics background, complements my curiosity in the financial domain.
             </p>
             <p>
                I look forward to learning, exploring, and delving deeper into anything that can be expressed as numbers or equations.
